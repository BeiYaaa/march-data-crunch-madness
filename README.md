Based on Kaggleâ€™s Machine Learning Mania(https://www.kaggle.com/c/mens-machine-learning-competition-2018#evaluation ), competitors predict the probability that a team wins any given game in the 2018 March Madness Tournament. Logloss is used as evaluation.  One of the highlight of out project is the new variable, academic performance. Another one is the project's philosophy, less is more. We tried to use as less variables as possible to explain the impact of each competition and build as simple model as possible to predict the results of 2018 NCAA(National Collegiate Athletic Association). Besides, we got the lowest logloss, 0.5478. Finally, we won the first prize of this year's competition and compared with the result on Kaggle, we are actually the fourth among more than 900 teams.
